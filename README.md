# Deriving metrics thresholds: A context-based approach

## Abstract
_[Background] Software measurements play a key role in the quality management process, since they allow the evaluation of the effectiveness of methods, tools and software processes in the context to which they are applied. However, despite their potential benefits, the software measurements have the limitation of being used for quantification, therefore not providing support for decision making purpose. [Goal] Thus, to try to change this scenario and popularize this purpose, it is important to set meaningful thesholds, enabling a better interpretation of the software metrics. In this perspective, several authors presented approaches to define reference values, but these approaches are not necessarily appropriate for software quality and they do not take into account each software's development context. [Results] Thus, this work aims to define a new approach based on statistic analysis, which will eliminate the problems presented. In addition, for each metric, the derived values are classified as low risk, moderate risk, high risk and very high risk, enabling better decision-making related to the software process. [Conclusions] Moreover, to validate the values that were found, the proposed approach was applied to six metrics that were defined in Chidamber and Kemerer's works. In this context, ability of these thresholds to find errors in the software development process was tested._
